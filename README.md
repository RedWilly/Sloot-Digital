To run the code, you will first need to have Python installed on your computer. 
You can check if you have Python installed by running the following command in a terminal or command prompt:

>python --version

If Python is installed, this command will print the version number, such as Python 3.8.5. If Python is not installed, 
you will need to install it before you can run the code.

Once you have Python installed, you can run the scripts by using the python command followed by the name of the script and any required arguments. 
For example, to run the encode.py script, you would use the following command: 

>python encode.py input_file 
>output_file // 
or 
>python encode.py input_file output_file

This will run the encode.py script and compress the input_file, saving the compressed file to output_file. 
Similarly, you can run the decode.py script by using the following command:

>python decode.py input_file output_file

This will run the decode.py script and decompress the input_file, saving the decompressed file to output_file.
